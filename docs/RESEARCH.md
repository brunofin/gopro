Understood. I'll investigate the webcam stream latency issue with the GoPro Hero12 Black, focusing on relevant settings and API parameters within the OpenGoPro Python SDK and other solutions. I'll search authoritative sources for ways to reduce the delay, aiming for near-real-time streaming. I'll report back with my findings and any recommended settings.

Here are the main factors that affect the latency of GoPro camera streams and the settings you can adjust to minimise delay when using the Open‑GoPro Python SDK.  Most of these settings can be changed via the HTTP API or the Python SDK, and they apply equally to the HERO12 Black.  Citations from the official Open‑GoPro documentation are included for reference.

### Why you see a delay

GoPro cameras encode video internally and then deliver it as an MPEG‑TS stream over USB or Wi‑Fi.  Even with no buffering on your PC, the camera itself needs \~210 ms to capture and encode each frame.  Off‑the‑shelf players and decoders (e.g., ffplay, VLC, OpenCV) often add their own buffers, increasing the delay.  Stabilisation (HyperSmooth/horizon levelling) adds a huge processing pipeline; when stabilisation is enabled, minimum latency jumps from ≳100 ms to over 1 110 ms.  Therefore, the 700 ms delay you are seeing is not unusual if you are using default settings with stabilisation on and standard ffmpeg decoding.

### Camera settings to reduce latency

1. **Disable HyperSmooth and other processing.**
   The API enumerations for the HyperSmooth setting (135) show that a value of 0 turns it off; other values enable Low, High, Boost, or Auto Boost.  Turning this setting off removes frame buffering and cuts latency drastically.  Also turn off horizon leveling (setting 150 = 0) and remove any digital lens mods.

2. **Use the Preview stream instead of Webcam mode.**
   The official streaming table shows that the Preview stream (480p/720p) has the lowest latency (≳100 ms when unstabilised).  Webcam mode uses a higher‑quality encoder and delivers 720p or 1080p at \~6 Mb/s, so latency is higher.  If the goal is a real‑time feed, call `gopro/preview/start` (through the SDK or HTTP) instead of `gopro/webcam/start`.  When you need USB webcam functionality, start preview and pipe the UDP stream to v4l2loopback.

3. **Lower the resolution and bit rate.**
   Higher resolutions require more processing and increase latency.  Use 720p or even 480p; the API call `gp/gpWebcam/START?res=4` (480p), `res=7` (720p) or `res=12` (1080p) is used on the webcam endpoint.  Using a smaller frame also reduces CPU load when decoding.  The Video Bit Rate setting (182) allows `0` for “Standard” and `1` for “High”; choose the standard bit‑rate option to decrease encoded frame size.

4. **Pick a narrower digital lens (FOV).**
   In webcam mode the digital lens (setting 43) supports Wide (0), Narrow (2), SuperView (3) and Linear (4).  Narrow or Linear modes crop the sensor and reduce the number of pixels that need to be processed, which lowers encoding latency.

5. **Disable other processing features.**
   Turn off GP‑level audio, GPS and other overlays.  Ensure the `Video Performance Mode` is set to “Maximum Video Performance” rather than battery‑saving modes (setting 173 = 0).

### Host‑side (PC) adjustments

1. **Use a low‑buffer decoder.**
   The FAQ notes that ffplay/vlc introduce buffering and suggests disabling it with `--no-cache` on the receiving side and `-fflags nobuffer` on the sender.  When using ffmpeg/ffplay to pipe the MPEG‑TS stream into a webcam device, include these flags to reduce queueing.  In gstreamer or OpenCV, reduce queue elements and set `max-latency` to 0 or very small values.

2. **Avoid RTMP and high‑level live‑stream protocols.**
   The documentation explicitly recommends avoiding RTMP for preview purposes because it adds unnecessary steps and buffering.  Always use the UDP preview stream for low‑latency monitoring.

3. **Build your own decoding pipeline.**
   The FAQ notes that the best latency is achieved “by building your own pipeline or ffmpeg’s library for decoding the bytes”.  The Open‑GoPro SDK only demonstrates a simple ffplay example; implementing a custom gstreamer or ffmpeg pipeline allows you to minimise internal buffers and achieve \~200–300 ms latency.

### Example workflow

1. Use the Python SDK to connect over USB and claim control.
2. Disable Hypersmooth and horizon leveling:

   ```python
   cam.set_setting(135, 0)  # hypersmooth off
   cam.set_setting(150, 0)  # horizon level off
   cam.set_setting(182, 0)  # standard bit rate
   cam.set_setting(43, 2)   # narrow digital lens
   ```
3. Start preview or webcam with low resolution:

   ```python
   cam.webcam.start(res=7, fov=2)  # 720p, narrow FOV
   ```

   or call the HTTP endpoint `gp/gpWebcam/START?res=7`.
4. Use ffmpeg to pipe the MPEG‑TS stream to a v4l2 device while disabling buffering:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -fflags nobuffer -i "udp://@0.0.0.0:8554?fifo_size=5000000" \
          -vf format=yuv420p -f v4l2 /dev/video42
   ```
5. In your video‑conferencing application select `/dev/video42` as the webcam.

With these changes you should be able to reduce latency from \~700 ms to the 200–300 ms range that GoPro considers the minimum achievable.  Complete elimination of latency is not possible because the camera requires time to capture and encode frames, but turning off stabilisation, using the lower‑resolution preview stream and minimising host‑side buffering will make the delay much less noticeable.
